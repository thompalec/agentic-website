# Websites for Agents

## Overview
Agentic Website converts human-centric websites into REST APIs, making them easily accessible and navigable by AI agents and automated systems.

## The Problem
Agentic AI has been all the buzz lately, and for good reason. But most of the products that are being launched are from a customer-centric perspective. Customers want to use AI agents to order food and make travel bookings. But the websites AI agents are interacting with are exclusively designed for human users. This makes it difficult for AI agents to interact with the website and leads to complex workarounds to simulate human behavior. Imagine if websites were designed with AI agents in mind!

## The Solution
We look at Agentic AI from a business perspective. Businesses want customers to use their website and buy things. By extension, they want customers to use AI agents to use their website and buy things. We are building a tool to convert websites into well-documented REST APIs, making it easy for agents to use our websites and do interactions.
